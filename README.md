Here are some java files for a simple game. I developped it for beating my friend.
The game is basicall like this: there is a triange
       1
      2 3
    4  5  6
  7  8  9  10
11 12 13 14 15

You and another player take turn and pick. Each time the player can pick one to three pieces in line. 
For instance, you can pick 1,2 or 4 or 6,14 or 3,5,8, but you can't pick 1,5 or 4,6 or 11,12,15 or 2,3,5.
Whoever pick the last number loses the game.
